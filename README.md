# Temperature-Tracker

Temperature Tracker
Write code to continually track the max, min, and avg as new numbers are inserted into a
tracker class.
Write a class TempTracker with these methods:
A method to insert a new temperature.
A method to get the highest temperature we’ve seen so far
A method to get the lowest temperature we’ve seen so far
A method to get the average of all temps we've seen so far
Optimize for space and time . Favor speeding up the getters over the setters.
Optionally we would like to see the solution in a private git repository (GitHub / Bitbucket)
commit by commit.
